            The Burger Builder was developed as part of a Udemy course on React 16; including hooks, the context API, Redux and Firebase's NoSQL database. The project highlights user authentication and storing persistent data using Firebase, a FE application using React with state management from Redux. Once authenticated you can create a burger using the controls at the bottom of the page and 'order' this burger. Orders are stored on a NoSQL database and can be viewed, if authenticated, in the Orders page

          Search through a data set of songs, either by searching for a specific track ID or by Artist name. The frontend uses a Bootstrap template and a React Frontend to serve the initiative UI. The app is served using Express and the API for querying and serving the data is also written using Express. Using TypeScript, development for this project was quick as I could utilise VSCode's built-in TypeScript support and reduce bugs that may otherwise have gone unnoticed.

          Using React16, the frontend framework Bootstrap React and the context API I designed and developed a city guide application. I used a mobile first approach for this project, using the Boostrap framework it's simple to create good looking UI layouts and components. The components are further styled using Styled Components the popular NPM module and React Router.
